# Snap Game
## By Saachi Pahwa

This game asks the user for:
1. The number of players
2. When the game should stop (called the stop condition)
3. What constitutes a "snap" - matching suit, matching rank, or either? (called the snap condition)

And a game of Snap matching these conditions is simulated.

Please run *Main.java* to begin.
